      question: "How should we divide our work?",
      answer:
        "As a team, start by identifying each member's strengths. If someone excels in backend development, assign them backend tasks. Likewise, let the frontend expert handle frontend work. For junior members, provide guidance by giving them manageable tasks that help them learn. Additionally, designate a team leader to coordinate efforts and keep the project on track. This approach ensures that responsibilities are distributed effectively, and everyone gets a chance to contribute.",
